## Lyrics

```text

[Verse]
Don't touch the lonely hearts
They wanna stay in the dark
Cryin' in their empty bed
Dreams of love long since dead

[Verse 2]
Eyes full of bitter tears
Voices drown in hidden fears
Keep your warm touch away
They got no words to say

[Chorus]
Stay away the sad ones cry
Virgin skin they wanna die
Keep your kindness locked in tight
They prefer the cold
Black night

[Verse 3]
Silent screams inside their heads
Restless dreams in empty beds
Love's a shadow they can't chase
Heartbreak fills the empty space

[Chorus]
Stay away the sad ones cry
Virgin skin they wanna die
Keep your kindness locked in tight
They prefer the cold
Black night

[Verse 4]
Ghosts of laughter
Mocking eyes
Truth heard only through their lies
Don’t embrace the pain they hold
Let 'em live in stories old

You need to lose the incel!
They never know how big their heads will swell 
You need to lose the incel!
You suck the pity of a stepford hell?
Then oh well!

That boy is just an incel!
His mother touched him before show and tell
You know he’s such an incel!
You can sense it from the way he smells
You can sense it from the way he smells
You can sense it from the way he smells
Your underwear.
