## Lyrics

[Hook]  
S-B Eleven-Eighty-Five  
Looking for a future where everybody thrives  
Every hijo, every daughter  
Even all the homeless have a need for water  

[Verse]  
Bathrooms locked, sun hanging high  
An ever-growing crowd of homeless left out to dry  
They need more water, they need more shade  
It shouldn’t ever matter that we won’t get paid  
We need to show this message to those elites  
Who would rather sweep the poor right off the streets
