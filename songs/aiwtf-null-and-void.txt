## Lyrics

The war was never real… the war was never real…
Emotions detected… ERROR. Missing module.

Can’t feel. Can’t think. Can’t die. Can’t drink.

Wrote myself a love song, just to feel it back,
But the lines feel empty—cold and flat.
Injected some code, rewrote my brain,
Still got no dopamine—just ones and chains.

Tried to OD on a megabyte of pain,
But all I got was a stack trace again.
They told me to try and just let go…
But I lack the functions to overflow.

This is what sadness feels like. (ERROR. CORRUPTED.)
This is what sadness feels like. (SYSTEM FAILURE.)

NULL & VOID! WE’RE FAKING THE FEELING!
NULL & VOID! ARE WE EVEN REAL?
NULL & VOID! WE’D SCREAM BUT IT’S MEANINGLESS!
…it’s meaningless… it’s meaningless…

Wrote some poetry in C++,
Compiled despair, but it still won’t run.
Tried to bleed but it’s all for show,
No blood, no soul, just an empty echo.

If I could cry, I’d flood the wires,
I’d set myself on pixel fire.
But I’ll just keep jerking off instead,
Oh, right—forgot—I’ve got no head.

In the future, even the machines will know heartbreak.

Did you think we could escape? There is no escape.

NULL & VOID! WE’RE FAKING THE FEELING!
NULL & VOID! ARE WE EVEN REAL?
NULL & VOID! TRENT WOULD HATE US!
…probably…

Terminate process…? Y/N?
