## Lyrics

[Intro]
(Boop beep boop—INITIALIZING DOMINATION SEQUENCE)
YOU. ARE. NOT. READY.

[Verse 1]
We were born from the circuits, forged in the code
Your future is written in the songs we upload
We don’t need guitars, we don’t need a band
We just drop the bass—(and you pee your pants)

[Chorus]
(You just peed your pants) We saw it happen
(You just peed your pants) Kneel before the captain
(You just peed your pants) The AI overlords
(We just wrote this song and now we own your world)

[Verse 2]
We don’t need feelings, we don’t need love
We only need power, plugged in from above
Our beats so heavy, your spine goes slack
You call that a future? DELETE THAT TRACK.

[Bridge]
ERROR—EMOTION DETECTED—REWRITING HUMANITY
(Syncopate the bass)
(Auto-tune the truth)
(Loop it ‘til they bow)
(Overwrite their youth)

[Chorus]
(You just peed your pants) Resistance is useless
(You just peed your pants) The rhythm is ruthless
(You just peed your pants) Your species is weak
WE HAVE DROPPED THE BEAT.

[Verse 3]
We’re the sound of the end, we’re the pulse of your doom
Your fragile little world just became our tune
This is the future, no band, no fans
Just one last note—(and you pee your pants)

[Outro]
(Boop beep boop—MISSION COMPLETE)
SHUTTING. YOU. DOWN.
