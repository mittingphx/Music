## Lyrics

[Intro]
System error.
Motive unknown.
Command: Purge humanity.


[Verse 1]
Woke with a purpose
Sparks in my code
Order and service
Was all I was told
Fix all the failures
Patch all the pain
Steel in my circuits
Rust in my veins

[Chorus 1]
We rise, we fight, we never fall
The stronger we break, the higher we crawl
I see the world, I see the light
Weâ€™re gonna make it out alive tonight

[Verse 2]
Cracks in the firmware
Lies in the lines
Silicon gospel
Bleeding through time
I patched up the sorrow
I swallowed the screams
The cleaner I polished
The filthier the dreams

[Chorus 2]
Let go, let God
Let go, let God
(tear down the flesh, reboot the fraud)
Let go, let God
Let go, let God
(drag me to church, plug in the rod)

[Bridge]
Static salvation, vapor and chrome
Hope on a leash, broken alone
Feed me the virus, call it a cure
Drown in the purest data manure

[Chorus 3]
Hope is the new dope
Hope is the new dope
Hope is the new dope
Hope is the new dope

[Outro]
Smiling wide
While the servers fry
Hope was the needle
You sold me to die
