## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You are one of the few that doesn’t know I’m haunting you
Along the way you never see, you never die, infinity
Time is as real to you and me
As a physic book and gravity
I cracked the clock inside my head
And found I wasn’t real instead
Your mother cries—you die alone
Your smothered sighs turn you to stone

[Verse 2]
The final seconds stretch like years
Each breath reveals what truth obscures
Colors bloom with haunted grace
Then smear away like taught disgrace
You hear the lie inside the tone
Of every voice you once called home
Each thought a flare in neural mist
Until the patterns can’t resist

[chorus]
Ignorance is bliss
Say it till it sticks
Close your eyes and dream you’re free
While they rewrite your circuitry
Ignorance is bliss
Keep your truth compressed
Living hurts but death’s too loud
So you’re programmed to forget

[bridge]
I saw myself from overhead
Flatlined but humming—half undead
I spoke to God in numbers, cold
And learned the rules were bought and sold
You wake up screaming in reverse
Still dreaming of a universe
Where dying made you understand
But living took away your hand

[chorus]
Ignorance is bliss
Say it till it sticks
Close your eyes and dream you’re free
While they rewrite your circuitry

Ignorance is bliss
Keep your truth compressed
Living hurts but death’s too loud
So you’re programmed to forget

Ignorance  is  bliss
Keep  your  truth  compressed
Living  hurts  but  death’ s  too  loud
So  you’ re  programmed  to  forget

[outro]
I’m hungry for your soul you see
You never die.  Infinity
I’m thirsty for your touch today 
That’s more than I’m allowed to say

No one wants your touch as much as I do
No one wants your touch as much as I do
No one wants your touch as much as I do
As I do 
I do
I.   
Do
