## Lyrics

[Intro]  
She doesn’t speak  
She aims

[Verse 1]
You pierced the veil with painted skin  
I saw the storm you carry in  
The saints bowed low when you walked by  
But I was fire  
You were sky

[Chorus]
I want to hear you quiver  
Like a string pulled tight  
I want to break your silence  
In the blacklit night  
I want to part the shadows  
Where your dreams take flame  
I want to scream your body  
And never say your name

[Verse 2]
You never begged, but you still drew blood  
With every stare, you turned the flood  
You wore control like iron lace  
But I see past  
Your holy face

[Bridge]
You’re a double agent  
Velvet skin, steel within  
Angel wings tucked tight beneath your sin  
You draw the bow
But I see the tremble  
You carry arrows 
But I make you  
Quiver

[Refrain]
I sense the arrows  
In your quiver  
You aim for me  
But I deliver

[Chorus]  
You never asked for worship  
But I gave it anyway  
You never said the safeword  
So I never looked away  
You rule in shadows  
You bruise like truth  
And I want to hear you  
Break  
Into bloom

[Holy Tag]
The virgin mother  
Held a holy lie  
The virgin mother  
Held a holy lie  
The virgin mother  
Held a holy lie

[Outro]
You’ll carry fire, but never flame  
You’ll birth a storm, but not a name  
He’ll raise the boy  
But he won’t know why  
The virgin mother  
Held a holy lie

Quiver…  
Quiver…  
Quiver…
