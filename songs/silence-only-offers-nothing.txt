## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
A message sent into the dark,
No echo, no return.
You disappear without a trace,
And silence swallows every word.

[Verse 2]
Was it shame or was it thrill?
Was it guilt or just the kill?
You never spoke, never faced the wreck,
Left me drowning in the disconnect.

[Bridge]
Silence is gaslighting.
An empty page, an unread line.
Did you think your quiet made you kind?
You erase me, but I still write.

[Verse 1]
Did you even hesitate?
Or did it thrill you more to know
That I’d be the one who’d have to wait?
Left with silence, left alone.

[Verse 2]
Was it just the heat, the rush?
The thrill of knowing I’d combust?
Do I only exist when it feels good?
Is love just fire to you, just wood?


[Bridge]
Silence is gaslighting
(Silence) 
An empty page, an unread line.
(Your silence)
Did you think your quiet made you kind?
(Your quiet)
You erase me, but I still writer
(Oh please erase me)

(Please erase me, Avryana)

[Outro]
Silence is gaslighting
(Please erase me) 
An empty page, an unread line.
(Please erase me Avry)
Did you think your quiet made you kind?
(Oh please erase it all)
You erase me, but I still writer
(Oh please erase me)

Silence is gaslighting
(Please erase me) 
An empty page, an unread line.
(Please erase me baby)
Did you think your quiet made you kind?
(Oh please erase it all)
You erase me, but I still writer
(Oh please erase me)

Silence is gaslighting
(I remember forgetting) 
An empty page, an unread line.
(My memories were never forgotten)
Did you think your quiet made you kind?
(Perhaps I had spoiled you rotten)
You erase me, but I still writer
(But I still write)
