## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I let you walk, I let you breathe,
I gave you space, but you gave me grief.
The silence speaks where words won’t go,
A tangled truth I’ll never know.

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m not the one who’ll sit and wait,
While you rewrite our love as fate.
There’s a weight to every word you hide,
And I’m done letting it slide.

[Chorus]
I need some answers I deserve,
Don’t leave me drowning in the hurt.
You’ve got the truth locked in your hands,
And I’m here breaking where I stand.

[Verse 2]
You act like time will heal the mess,
But you built walls I can’t assess.
I gave my all, but you gave doubt,
A love that burned and then burned out.

[Pre-Chorus]
I won’t be chained to your design,
While you keep dancing on my time.
The questions linger in my mind,
I need the truth you left behind.

[Chorus]
I need some answers I deserve,
Don’t leave me drowning in the hurt.
You’ve got the truth locked in your hands,
And I’m here breaking where I stand.

[Bridge]
If it was love, why does it ache?
If you were mine, why did you break?
I’m not asking for redemption’s song,
I just need to know where I went wrong.

[Chorus]
I need some answers I deserve,
Don’t let me drown in what you’ve blurred.
The lies, the games, they all collide,
I won’t let you leave me denied.

[Outro]
I need some answers… I deserve.
