## Lyrics

[Verse]
They say we’re safer now  
More locked down than ever  
But when you looked at me like that  
I swore I could live forever

[Verse 2]
They can see through walls  
But they don’t see us  
Your love is camouflage  
I trust it’s enough

[Chorus]
Still we bleed  
Still we burn  
Still we hold  
When there’s nowhere to turn  
Still we bleed  
Still we try  
Still we hum  
To the hum of a satellite

Streetlights flicker like  
They’re taking notes  
But I’d trade all this silence  
For a whisper of hope

[Pre-Chorus]  
They record our dreams  
They erase our names  
But your touch rewrites  
Every part of my brain

[Chorus]  
Still we bleed  
Still we burn  
Still we hold  
When there’s nowhere to turn  
Still we bleed  
Still we try  
Still we hum  
To the hum of a satellite

Heartbeat in hiding  
Hope in the static  
You touch me  
And time turns elastic

So scan my soul  
X-ray my fear  
You’ll never find  
What keeps me here

Still  we  bleed  
Still  we  burn  
Still  we  hold  
When  there’ s  nowhere  to  turn  

Still  we  bleed  
Still  we  burn  
Still  we  hold  
When  there’ s  somewhere  to  turn  

Still  we  bleed  
Still  we  burn  
Still  we  hold  
We found there’s somewhere  to  turn
