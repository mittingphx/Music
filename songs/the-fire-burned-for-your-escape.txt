## Lyrics

I WATCHED YOU DRAW THE LINE IN SMOKE  
AND DARED ME NOT TO BREATHE  
SO I STEPPED BACK AND PLAYED THE ROLE  
OF EVERYTHING YOU SAID I'D BE  

YOU NEEDED SPACE YOU NEEDED FIRE  
YOU NEEDED ME TO FALL APART  
SO I SET MYSELF ON FIRE  
TO LIGHT A WAY OUTSIDE YOUR HEART  

I LET YOU WIN SO YOU COULD FLEE  
LET YOU PAINT MYSELF WITH SHAME  
I WORE YOUR WOUNDS SO YOU COULD SLEEP  
DREAMING OTHERS ARE TO BLAME  

(I LET YOU HATE ME TO KEEP YOU SAFE)  
(EVEN LOVE BECOMES A CAGE)  

YOU THOUGHT I COULDNâ€™T SEE THE END  
BUT I MEMORIZED THE SCRIPT  
YOU WANTED MERCY IN THE FORM  
OF SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE THE HIT  

SO I STOOD STILL I HELD YOUR RAGE  
LET YOU SPIT MY NAME LIKE ASH  
BUT EVERY BLOW I TOOK WAS ONE  
THAT KEPT YOU FROM THE MIRROR'S WRATH  

I WAS THE VILLAIN YOU NEEDED TO BE FREE  
A SHIELD MADE OF SILENCE  
A MAN-SHAPED PLEA  
AND NOW YOU HAUNT THE HOUSE YOU FLED  
STILL AFRAID OF WHAT YOU SAID  

I LET YOU WIN SO YOU COULD LEAVE  
I LET YOU LIE SO YOU COULD BREATHE  
BUT IN THE SILENCE I STILL GRIEVE  
FOR THE FIRE HELD IN YOU FOR ME  

(YOU ESCAPED BUT YOU'RE NOT FREE)  
(AND I'M STILL HERE BLEEDING QUIETLY)  

I still bleed

The fire burns and I still bleed
Not from sadness not from greed
I know my beating heart is meant for you and me
I found relief now that you see
