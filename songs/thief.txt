## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Did you feel your curse
Of reckoning reflected?
Did this enemy of yours
Leave you rejected?
Were you confused
By their own view
Of you reflected?
Are you afraid you
Too will be left here
Neglected?

[Chorus]
It’s control
Deception
Down underneath

A deep hole
You keep digging
Did you find relief?

Where’s your soul?
Connection?
You have belief?
No fear
Submission
You found the thief

[Bridge – Spoken Word Sample]
The medium screams from her visions: (true story)
“Don’t you dare. Don’t do it.”
“The best thing about it is you don’t have to do it.”                                                                                              

[Verse 2]
Someone’s dug a hole to China
Someone else wants your ass back
They both should stop the digging
You can’t both love and send attack


[Chorus]
It’s control
Deception
Down underneath

A deep hole
You keep digging
Did you find relief?
Where’s your soul?
Connection?
You have belief?
"belief"

No fear
Submission
You found the thief

[Breakdown]
You are facing judgement
You are facing judgement
You are facing judgement
You are facing judgement


[Outro]
It’s the third party, it’s not me
But that’s not what they want you to believe.
[delayed whisper: “believe… believe…” floats off]

Don’t listen to the trickster
You are fine
You are protected

[delayed whisper: “believe… believe…” floats off]
Don’ t  listen  to  the  trickster
You  are  fine
