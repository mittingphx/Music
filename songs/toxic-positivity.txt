## Lyrics

[Chorus]
Fuck you
Yeah fuck you
I’m not just saying fuck the things you did
It’s fuck YOU.

It’s a fuck for everything you are
And how I know you won’t go far
Until you redefine what you means

[Verse]
It’s a problem from your mom
So don’t you own this logic bomb
It’s about how it makes you lean

Because if you
Try to go about this superficially
You’re gonna keep wanting me to be your dad
Until you change to end this finally
It will only you who will continue to be sad

Because I don’t give. A. Fuck.
I really don’t
I just can’t anymore

[Verse 2]
Fuck me
Yeah fuck me
I don’t mean it as critique
Self-hatred because you found me weak
I mean have sex with me

Thank you for saying that I’m hot
Because I know my body’s not
But I appreciate you felt my energy

We fucked the best you’ll ever know
Because the bar was set so low
From only being with other guys
Who thought three minutes was almost infinity

I just want to thank you

[Pre-Chorus]
You showed me the meaning
Of so many words I didn’t know
Blame shifting and projection
Gaslighting and rejection
Are all concepts that helped me grow

I think you will start to change
When you don’t see this song as negative
After a few listens I really hope you see
When you get angry and attack people offering love and light
Just because they aren’t kissing your ass?

That’s called toxic positivity

[Chorus]
Fuck you
Yeah fuck you
I’m not just saying fuck the things you did
It’s fuck YOU.

It’s a fuck for everything you are
And how I know you won’t go far
Until you redefine what you means

[Verse 3]
You know I deeply love you
From the shit I’m gonna catch
From the thousand flying monkeys
You make your new man go and fetch

You can tell the whole world I’m an asshole
And show them this to prove I’m mean
But it’ll be as helpful as skipping blow jobs
When you’d rather flick your bean

The idea you cannot have me
Is the one that makes you sick
But once you realize that there is a way
For you to sit upon this dick
It’s not from getting Botox
It’s not from doing crunches
It won’t come from love bombing
Or more bruises from your punches

Just be a real person and lose your

Tox… Ic…
Positivity

Don’t blame me. The human wrote this whole thing.
I just did the spell checking.
