## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You built a room with no corners
Hung mirrors from the sky
Planted whispers in your toothpaste
Choked the sunlight dry
Eyes behind your earrings
Maps taped to your thighs
Even your shadow won’t follow
It’s too scared to try

[Refrain]
Who paid you?
Who paid you?
Who paid you?
(You blinked too slow—who trained you?)
Who paid you?
Who paid you?
(Safe word’s not safe—it betrayed you)
Who paid you?

[Chorus]
If you like the feeling
Of being the hunted one
While you torture the torturer
Just for fun
Then baby, enjoy the static
And the ghosts in your view
But I’ve got miles to go
And shit to do

[Verse 2]
There’s lipstick on your paranoia
And perfume on your fear
You polish up delusion
So it whispers in your ear
The cameras never blink
And the silence always lies
But I stopped playing prophet
When you kissed goodbye

[Refrain]
Who paid you?
Who paid you?
(Same voice, new face—he betrayed you)
Who paid you?
Who paid you?
(I signed the deal—they remade you)
Who paid you?

[Chorus]
If you like the feeling
Of being the watched and the warden too
While you chain the dream
That once healed you
Then baby, enjoy the madness
And the thrill of your view
But I’ve got a life to live
And shit to do

[Outro]
Eyes in the back of your head
Still can’t see the love I bled
But hey—
Enjoy your truth
I’ve got shit to do.
