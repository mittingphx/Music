## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
A fracture in the light, the glass refracts,
I saw the cracks in what we lacked.
Your once unbroken heart, so pure,
Now scattered pieces, unsure.

[Pre-Chorus]
I held the shards, they cut me deep,
Every night I begged for sleep.
But whispers filled the empty space,
A haunting voice I can’t erase.

[Chorus]
Your once unbroken, now undone,
A fleeting shadow lost to none.
Echoes whisper through the pain,
Calling me to you again.

[Verse 2]
I hear your voice in every sound,
A melody that pulls me down.
The ghost of you, it lingers near,
A fading truth I hold so dear.

[Pre-Chorus]
The whispers spin, they circle wide,
A symphony of what we hide.
Each note, a tear, a story told,
A love so young, a pain so old.

[Chorus]
Your once unbroken, now undone,
A fleeting shadow lost to none.
Echoes whisper through the pain,
Calling me to you again.

[Outro]
Your once unbroken, it haunts my soul,
A shattered story we can’t make whole.
The echoes fade, the light grows dim,
But I still reach for life within.

[Bridge]
Your voice it whispers soft and low
Remember me and do you feel this
(do you feel this)
My words dissolve in distant echoes.
It wasn’t enough? Why did you go
(Why did you go?)
[instruments continue - electricity noises increase in a slow pulsing cycle]
My subtle cries and sighs still echo
(Remember me)
Reflected, panned across the stereo field

[Outro – Softly whispered]
Your once unbroken, it haunts my soul,
A shattered story we can’t make whole.
[Sexy whisper] “Remember me…” [fades into echoes]
The echoes fade, the light grows dim,
But I still breathe the life within.

[Chorus]
Your once unbroken, now undone,
A fleeting shadow lost to none.
[Building into final chorus]
Echoes whisper through the pain,
Calling me to you again.

[Final Chorus]
Your once unbroken, now undone,
A fleeting shadow lost to none.
The echoes whisper through the pain,
But I won’t call for you again.
